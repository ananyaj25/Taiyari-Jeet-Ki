        <img src="C:\Users\Bhargavi Arya\Desktop\Yaadon ki gullak\Tom and jerry.png" alt="Tom and Jerry"><li> Tom and Jerry- There's no 
            ounce of doubt that these  two cartoon character i.e, Tom and Jerry, 
        <br> never failed to bring a hefty amount of laughter. They never uttered a single word, but their never ending fights, 
        <br> and tom getting bashed by his own tactics made us roll over the floor again and again. Without any question, tom and jerry 
        <br> is probably one of its only kind, and the kids from 90s and 2000s have got their “hamare zamane ka” cartoon.</li>

        <img src="C:\Users\Bhargavi Arya\Desktop\Yaadon ki gullak\Shin.jpg" alt="Shinchan"><li> Shinchan- Just as its title song, 
        <br> it actually used to make us all “pagal” with his cute yet savage behaviours. The Nohara family was supposedly the most 
        <br> relatable family which we ever saw, and their daily life situations and how they used to tackle with them was what made 
        <br> it so unique and loved among everyone. I am quite sure that you , yes you , still watch that show. Haina?</li>

        <li><img src="C:\Users\Bhargavi Arya\Desktop\Yaadon ki gullak\Courage.jpg" alt="Courage">Courage: The cowardly dog-  One of the most unique and creative show of our times, courage as 
        <br> opposed to his name was a coward, but do you really think he was? Whenever Eustace and Muriel needed his help, he always 
        <br> stood strong, overcame his fears and saved them. He made our first impressions of how loyal and cute dogs are, 
        <br> doesn’t he?</li>

        <li><img src="" alt="">Oswald- Big blue octopus, made us think that octopuses are actually that cute (lol). 
        <br>His usually peaceful life, which often use to get interrupted due to him helping out his friends in best way possible. 
        <br>Growing up we made Oswald and his friends as goals, because of the never ending behaviour of being their for our friends 
        <br>always!</li>

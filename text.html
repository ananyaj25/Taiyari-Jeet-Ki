        Shinchan- Just as its title song, 
        it actually used to make us all “pagal” with his cute yet savage behaviours. The Nohara family was supposedly the most 
        relatable family which we ever saw, and their daily life situations and how they used to tackle with them was what made 
        it so unique and loved among everyone. I am quite sure that you , yes you , still watch that show. Haina?

        Courage: The cowardly dog-  One of the most unique and creative show of our times, courage as 
        opposed to his name was a coward, but do you really think he was? Whenever Eustace and Muriel needed his help, he always 
        stood strong, overcame his fears and saved them. He made our first impressions of how loyal and cute dogs are, 
        doesn't he?

        Tom and Jerry- There's no ounce of doubt that these  two cartoon character i.e, Tom and Jerry, 
         never failed to bring a hefty amount of laughter. They never uttered a single word, but their never ending fights, 
         and tom getting bashed by his own tactics made us roll over the floor again and again. Without any question, tom and jerry 
         is probably one of its only kind, and the kids from 90s and 2000s have got their “hamare zamane ka” cartoon.

        Oswald- Big blue octopus, made us think that octopuses are actually that cute (lol). 
        His usually peaceful life, which often use to get interrupted due to him helping out his friends in best way possible. 
        Growing up we made Oswald and his friends as goals, because of the never ending behaviour of being their for our friends 
        always!
